# Introduction

The 3D-Car project is an application that displays and controls a 3D car model in a browser using Unity WebGL build. Users can interact with the car through a web interface embedded in Playground, which provides APIs to control the car's functions.

## Technologies Used
- Blender: Editing and optimizing the 3D car model.
- Unity WebGL: Exporting the car model as WebGL to run in a browser.
- HTML, JavaScript: Web interface for displaying and controlling the car.
  
## Workflow
- Edit the car model in Blender and export it to Unity.
- In Unity, set up components and program the car's functions.
- Build the Unity project as WebGL and embed it into Playground.
- Playground provides APIs to communicate with the WebGL build.
- The HTML interface receives data from the Playground API and controls the car model.
  
## Directory Structure
```
3D-Car/
¬¶-- Playground Unity/                 # Folder containing all Unity assets
¬¶-- Build/                            # Unity WebGL build
¬¶-- Web/                                       
¬¶   +-- MainIndex.html               # Folder containing HTML files and web resources
¬¶   +-- FromUnity.js                 # Handles interaction with MainIndex.html from Unity
¬¶-- README.md                        # Project documentation
```

## Usage Guide
- Run WebGL Build:
- Open the Build/ folder and run the WebGL build.
- Embed MainIndex.html into Playground to connect with the API.
  
## Integration with Playground:
- Playground sends control data to WebGL via API.
- Actions such as changing the car color, adjusting speed, etc., are executed using Unity functions.

### Option 1: Live Server (VS Code extension)
- Install the **Live Server** extension.
- Right-click `MainIndex.html` ‚Üí **Open with Live Server**.

## üß± Project Code Structure

This project is a WebGL-based Unity application that controls a 3D car model. The car has various interactive features such as opening/closing doors, turning lights on/off, and adjusting seat positions. All functionalities are encapsulated and managed by a centralized controller.

### üèó Code Architecture


### üîÅ Flow Overview

1. Individual car parts (door, seat, lights...) are modular scripts.
2. `CarController` acts as the integration hub that references all parts.
3. External HTML communicates with Unity WebGL through JavaScript API calls.
4. Unity receives commands (as JSON or strings) and forwards them to the appropriate component.
5. Each component implements a shared interface for consistent communication (`IActions`, `ILockable`, etc).

### üß© Key Features

- Modular component design for easy expansion.
- Centralized command processing via `CarController`.
- HTML integration for remote or UI-based control.
- Interface-driven architecture for flexibility.
